# Biography

I am a Ph.D student in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research at UC Berkeley working with Professor  [Anil Aswani](https://aswani.ieor.berkeley.edu/). My research is mainly focused on the interplay between control systems and optimization, with emphasis on safety and performance of cyber physical and autonomous systems. I have work experience with software development of embeddable optimization algorithms for real-time applications as well as large-scale optimization problems.
I am also interested in all aspects of computational optimization, from modeling techniques to practical
implementations.

I have collaborated with Professor [Ram Vasudevan](http://www.roahmlab.com/ram-personal) at Univertisy of Michigan and with [Rien Quirynen](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=i3vsPLcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Stefano Di Cairano](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=Kl8rWSgAAAAJ&hl=en) at Mistubishi Electric Research Laboratories [MERL](http://www.merl.com/).
